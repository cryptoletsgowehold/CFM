Crypto-Friendly Music
is one of the most efficient phenomenons for embracing moments and to feel connected with others.
Even during a crisis, music plays a vital role. 

The goal of this project is to create a HQ crypto-related album [b]HODLIN[/b] (with 15 tracks) in order to normalize the crypto industry.
Collaborating musicians (string & brass players) and sound technicians are welcomed!
15 songs in total will be produced, leaving ~1 ETH compensation per track.
All collaborating musicians/sound technicians will receive equal shares of the compensation for any track they participate in.

Crowdfunding is required in order to finance studio time, cables/strings and expenses during the project.
The goal is to reach ~15.00 ETH or 1.00 BTC, after which the project kicks off.

The first song [b]Jump the Rocket[/b] for the album is already finished, as a "showcase demo".
All other tracks will be released here for feedback prior to the album release.

Take care of each other and don't forget to hodl.
